# Auth_Wiki_Team2
This is a webapp that hosts several authentication codes for various programming languages. 

## Description
- This webapp was built to host a variety of authentication codes. Users all over the world can view these codes and can also register in order to download, interact,   and leave comments on the codes. With its responsive design, users can access the webapp via their laptops, desktops, mobile devices,etc without any display issues.
- **Technology Used**: This webapp makes use of mostly Django. Django is a high-level Python web framework with pre-written composite codes for webdevelopment, thus     easing the stress of coding on the developers. It is reassuringly secure and exceedingly scalable.
- We hope to implement more authentication methods for user signup and to host more authentication codes in our library.

## How to Run Locally
  In your Command line interface:
  
  1. Clone the repository to your local machine :
  ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zuri-training/auth_wiki_team2.git
  ```
  
  2. Enter into the directory :      `cd auth_wiki_team2`
  
  3. Fetch for remote updates :      `git fetch origin` 
  
  4. Pull any recent changes from the main branch:  `git pull origin main`
  
  5. Install a vrtual environment package :        `pip install virtualenv`
  
  6. Create a virtual environment : `python -m venv env`
  
  7. Activate the virtual environment :   `env\Scripts\activate`
  
  8. Install dependencies :  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

  9. Make migrations:       `python manage.py makemigrations`
 
  10. Migrate all models :     `python manage.py migrate`
  
  11. Start Local Server:     `python manage.py runserver`
  
## How to Contribute
  1. Create a new branch to make your changes: `git checkout -b <your-branch-name>`  and make the required changes.
  
  2. Stage the file:  `git add <your-changed-file>`
  
  3. Commit your file: `git commit -m "<your-message>"`
  
     Also, make sure your commit message is detailed with what you changed and where you changed it.
  
  4. Push your local changes:  `git push origin <your-branch-name>` 
  
     If an error occurs here, it means that someone has made changes to the original file while you were working.
    
     Simply run : `git pull origin main`  to sync your local file with the current main file and run `git push origin <your-branch-name>` again.
    
  5. Visit the remote url on Github to create a pull request.
  
  6. Wait for the team leader to accept your pull request.
